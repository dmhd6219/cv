## Content

The CV is divided into sections that typically include:

- Skills

The template is flexible and can be customized to fit individual preferences and needs.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can download and install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

Once you have a LaTeX distribution installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dmhd6219/cv.git
```

## Building the CV

1. Edit the `main.tex` file using a text editor of your choice.
2. Customize the content in each section to match your personal information, education, experience, etc.
3. Save your changes.

In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory and run the following commands to compile the CV:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```

This will generate a `main.pdf` file in the same directory.

## Customization

The template is designed to be highly customizable. You can adjust the styling, fonts, colors, and layout to your liking by modifying the LaTeX code in the `main.tex` file. Additionally, you can explore LaTeX documentation and tutorials to learn more about advanced customization.
